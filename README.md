Technologies Used
HTML5: Markup language for structuring web pages.
CSS3: Styling language used for layout and design.
JavaScript: Functionality implemented using:
DOM Manipulation: For dynamic content updates.
Objects and OOP: Organizing code and creating reusable components.
ES6 Features: Used for improved syntax (e.g., arrow functions, let/const, template literals).
Async JavaScript: For handling asynchronous operations, such as API calls.
Responsive Design
The Avalovin application has been built to be responsive, ensuring that all features function correctly on devices of various sizes. The CSS media queries and flexible grid layouts were used to achieve this responsiveness.

Challenges Faced
During the development of Avalovin, I encountered several challenges:

JavaScript Complexity: Navigating through complex JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, OOP, and async programming was initially difficult. However, I managed to overcome these hurdles with persistent learning and debugging.
Making it Visually Attractive: While the focus was on functionality, I found it challenging to create a visually appealing design. I prioritized user experience over aesthetics but plan to improve the UI in future iterations.
Implementing Responsiveness: Ensuring that all elements adapted correctly across devices required extensive testing and adjustments.
